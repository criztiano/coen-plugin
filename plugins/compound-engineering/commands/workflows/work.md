# Work Plan Execution Command

Execute a work plan efficiently while maintaining quality and finishing features.

## Introduction

This command takes a work document (plan, specification, or todo file) and executes it systematically. The focus is on **shipping complete features** by understanding requirements quickly, following existing patterns, and maintaining quality throughout.

## Input Document

<input_document> #$ARGUMENTS </input_document>

## Execution Workflow

### Phase 1: Quick Start

1. **Read Plan and Clarify**

   - Read the work document completely
   - Review any references or links provided in the plan
   - If anything is unclear or ambiguous, ask clarifying questions now
   - Get user approval to proceed
   - **Do not skip this** - better to ask questions now than build the wrong thing

2. **Setup Environment**

   Choose your work style:

   **Option A: Live work on current branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout main && git pull origin main
   git checkout -b feature-branch-name
   ```

   **Option B: Parallel work with worktree (recommended for parallel development)**
   ```bash
   # Ask user first: "Work in parallel with worktree or on current branch?"
   # If worktree:
   skill: git-worktree
   # The skill will create a new branch from main in an isolated worktree
   ```

   **Recommendation**: Use worktree if:
   - You want to work on multiple features simultaneously
   - You want to keep main clean while experimenting
   - You plan to switch between branches frequently

   Use live branch if:
   - You're working on a single feature
   - You prefer staying in the main repository

3. **Create Todo List**
   - Use TodoWrite to break plan into actionable tasks
   - Include dependencies between tasks
   - Prioritize based on what needs to be done first
   - Include testing and quality check tasks
   - Keep tasks specific and completable

### Phase 2: Execute

1. **Task Execution Loop**

   For each task in priority order:

   ```
   while (tasks remain):
     - Mark task as in_progress in TodoWrite
     - Read any referenced files from the plan
     - Look for similar patterns in codebase
     - Implement following existing conventions
     - Write tests for new functionality
     - Run tests after changes
     - Mark task as completed
   ```

2. **Follow Existing Patterns**

   - The plan should reference similar code - read those files first
   - Match naming conventions exactly
   - Reuse existing components where possible
   - Follow project coding standards (see CLAUDE.md)
   - When in doubt, grep for similar implementations

3. **Test Continuously**

   - Run relevant tests after each significant change
   - Don't wait until the end to test
   - Fix failures immediately
   - Add new tests for new functionality

4. **Figma Design Sync** (if applicable)

   For UI work with Figma designs:

   - Implement components following design specs
   - Use figma-design-sync agent iteratively to compare
   - Fix visual differences identified
   - Repeat until implementation matches design

5. **Track Progress**
   - Keep TodoWrite updated as you complete tasks
   - Note any blockers or unexpected discoveries
   - Create new tasks if scope expands
   - Keep user informed of major milestones

6. **Auto-Trigger Reviewers** (Incremental Review)

   After completing a significant chunk of work, trigger the appropriate reviewer based on files changed:

   ```bash
   # Check what files were modified
   git diff --name-only HEAD~1..HEAD
   ```

   | Files Changed | Auto-Spawn Reviewer |
   |---------------|---------------------|
   | `*.tsx`, `*.jsx`, `components/*` | `senior-typescript-reviewer` |
   | `*.py` | `senior-python-reviewer` |
   | `*.css`, `*.scss`, `styles/*` | `design-implementation-reviewer` |
   | `store/*`, `context/*`, `hooks/*` | `frontend-races-reviewer` |
   | `migrations/*`, `db/*` | `data-integrity-guardian` |

   **How to trigger:**
   ```
   Task senior-typescript-reviewer("Review the TypeScript changes just made. Check type safety, patterns, and quality.")
   ```

   This provides immediate feedback during work. Then use `/workflows:finalize` at the end for cross-cutting checks + PR.

### Phase 3: Quality Check

1. **Run Core Quality Checks**

   Always run before submitting:

   ```bash
   # Run full test suite (use project's test command)
   # Examples: npm test, pytest, go test, bin/rails test, etc.

   # Run linting (per CLAUDE.md)
   # Use linting-agent before pushing to origin
   ```

2. **Consider Reviewer Agents** (Optional)

   Use for complex, risky, or large changes:

   - **code-simplicity-reviewer**: Check for unnecessary complexity
   - **performance-oracle**: Check for performance issues
   - **security-sentinel**: Scan for security vulnerabilities
   - **architecture-strategist**: Review architectural decisions

   Run reviewers in parallel with Task tool:

   ```
   Task(code-simplicity-reviewer): "Review changes for simplicity"
   Task(security-sentinel): "Scan for security issues"
   ```

   Present findings to user and address critical issues.

3. **Final Validation**
   - All TodoWrite tasks marked completed
   - All tests pass
   - Linting passes
   - Code follows existing patterns
   - Figma designs match (if applicable)
   - No console errors or warnings

### Phase 4: Ship It

1. **Create Commit**

   ```bash
   git add .
   git status  # Review what's being committed
   git diff --staged  # Check the changes

   # Commit with conventional format
   git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
   feat(scope): description of what and why

   Brief explanation if needed.
   EOF
   )"
   ```

2. **Capture and Upload Screenshots for UI Changes** (REQUIRED for any UI work)

   For **any** design changes, new views, or UI modifications, you MUST capture and upload screenshots:

   **Step 1: Start dev server** (if not running)
   ```bash
   # Use your project's dev server command (e.g., npm run dev, bin/dev, etc.)
   ```

   **Step 2: Capture screenshots with agent-browser CLI**
   ```bash
   agent-browser open http://localhost:[port]/[route]
   agent-browser snapshot -i
   agent-browser screenshot output.png
   ```
   See the `agent-browser` skill for detailed usage.

   **Step 3: Upload using imgup skill**
   ```bash
   skill: imgup
   # Then upload each screenshot:
   imgup -h pixhost screenshot.png  # pixhost works without API key
   # Alternative hosts: catbox, imagebin, beeimg
   ```

   **What to capture:**
   - **New screens**: Screenshot of the new UI
   - **Modified screens**: Before AND after screenshots
   - **Design implementation**: Screenshot showing Figma design match

   **IMPORTANT**: Save screenshot URLs for the PR description later.

3. **Next Step: Review or Finalize**

   **If you used auto-reviewers during work (incremental review):**
   ```
   /workflows:finalize
   ```
   Finalize runs only cross-cutting checks (security, architecture), browser tests, and creates the PR.

   **If you didn't use auto-reviewers:**
   ```
   /workflows:review
   ```
   Review runs full multi-agent analysis, resolves findings, then creates the PR.

## Key Principles

### Start Fast, Execute Faster

- Get clarification once at the start, then execute
- Don't wait for perfect understanding - ask questions and move
- The goal is to **finish the feature**, not create perfect process

### The Plan is Your Guide

- Work documents should reference similar code and patterns
- Load those references and follow them
- Don't reinvent - match what exists

### Test As You Go

- Run tests after each change, not at the end
- Fix failures immediately
- Continuous testing prevents big surprises

### Quality is Built In

- Follow existing patterns
- Write tests for new code
- Run linting before pushing
- Use reviewer agents for complex/risky changes only

### Ship Complete Features

- Mark all tasks completed before moving on
- Don't leave features 80% done
- A finished feature that ships beats a perfect feature that doesn't

## Completion Requirements

- [ ] All TodoWrite tasks marked completed
- [ ] Tests pass
- [ ] Linting passes


## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- **Analysis paralysis** - Don't overthink, read the plan and execute
- **Skipping clarifying questions** - Ask now, not after building wrong thing
- **Ignoring plan references** - The plan has links for a reason
- **Testing at the end** - Test continuously or suffer later
- **Forgetting TodoWrite** - Track progress or lose track of what's done
- **80% done syndrome** - Finish the feature, don't move on early
- **Over-reviewing simple changes** - Save reviewer agents for complex work
